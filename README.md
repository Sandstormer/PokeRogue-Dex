# PokeRogue SearchDex

### This is the repository for Sandstorm's [PokeRogue SearchDex](https://sandstormer.github.io/PokeRogue-Dex/), a fast and powerful way to search all the data in PokeRogue, with intuitive UI and advanced filtering. 
You can see which Pok√©mon learn a move and when they learn it, who has variant shinies, who has the highest stats, which biomes or eggs to find Pok√©mon, and much more. 

‚ùî See the help screen for instructions and a list of available filters.

üåê All the main text and filters have been translated into 6 languages.

‚≠ê If you enjoy my Pokedex, please share the link with other players, and leave me a star on Github!


## Development

üîß I regularly update this project with new features, and to reflect changes made to [the game](https://pokerogue.net/).
I worked really hard on this project, so if you want to use any part of my code, please let me know first.

I do not collect any personal data or have any way to identify repeat visitors. The site uses local storage only to remember your language selection. I use analytics on the site to see basic anonymized metrics. This helps me see how many people use the site, as well as things like screen size or browser language, so that I can prioritize developing new features. I do not distribute this data to third parties. If you do not wish to be counted in the stats, a simple adblocker will completely disable the analytics.
