# PokeRogue SearchDex

This is the repository for Sandstorm's [PokeRogue SearchDex](https://sandstormer.github.io/PokeRogue-Dex/), a fast and powerful way to search all the data in PokeRogue.


## Development

I regularly update this project with new features, and to reflect changes made to [the game](https://pokerogue.net/).

I worked really hard on this project, so if you want to use any part of my code, please let me know first.
